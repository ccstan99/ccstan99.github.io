I've been immersed in the exciting developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP). After years of homeschooling my kids, instilling a lifelong love of learning, it's finally my turn! Before all that, I originally studied [Computational Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/), got a MS Computer Science in [Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Stanford](https://hci.stanford.edu/), then did freelance work with interactive programming and design.

## Readings

- [AI/NLP Courses & Journals](/resources) - Particularly helpful resources when I started
- [Goodreads Bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/150236560-ccstan99?shelf=read) - Exploring all sorts of rabbit holes

## Presentations

The lovely people at [DataCircles](https://datacircles.org/) have provided a supportive environment to learn and share about AI & ML. Here's slides from my recent presentations:

- [AGI Safety](/docs/JournalClub%202022-03-02%20AGI%20Safety.pdf)
- [AI Gridworlds](/docs/JournalClub%202022-03-30%20AI%20Gridworlds.pdf)
- [Winograd Schema Challenge](/docs/JournalClub%202022-05-25%20NLP.pdf)
- [Sentence-BERT](/docs/JournalClub%202022-07-27%20SBERT.pdf)
- [Classification Metrics](/docs/HOML%20Ch3.pdf)
- [Training Models](/docs/HOML%20Ch4.pdf)
- [Dimensionality Reduction](/docs/HOML%20Ch8.pdf)
- [What is NLP?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3N7zoIcjtw&list=PLSGYwl5_qS6jEhXHXuEymvNYvrFuD2BOG&index=1)
- [What are Transformers?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bedJ9bQBG6s&list=PLSGYwl5_qS6jEhXHXuEymvNYvrFuD2BOG&index=2)

## Projects

The AGI Alignment ecosystem has interesting projects I've been helping with:

- **[stampy.ai](http://ui.stampy.ai)** — AGI Safety & Alignment FAQ headed by [Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMilesAI). I worked on the front-end UI/UX, [logo redesign](https://github.com/StampyAI/StampyAIAssets), and did some [light coding](https://github.com/StampyAI/stampy-ui): implemented [in-browser semantic search](/2022/07/05/use.html) & identified [duplicate questions](/2022/06/14/sbert.html) using NLP, created web workers to avoid GUI blocking issues, and used GitHub Actions to automate embeddings generation & website deployment.

## Mentoring

For students interested in STEM, here's some wonderful organizations:

- **[AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/)** — As a mentor for summer portfolio projects, I created some quick [overview videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3N7zoIcjtw&list=PLSGYwl5_qS6jEhXHXuEymvNYvrFuD2BOG&index=1) and a [tutorial notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/docs/huggingface-text-classification.ipynb) so students could perform NLP classification by fine-tuning a BERT Transformer on their dataset.
- **[Technovation Challenge](https://www.technovation.org/)** — Last few years, I've served as judge advisor, but I began by mentoring a team to create a mobile app social good. The [Rooting for You](https://sites.google.com/view/code-work-ahead/) app was the North America Regional Winner in 2020!
