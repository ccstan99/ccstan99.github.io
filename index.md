I've been immersed in the exciting developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP). After years of homeschooling my kids, instilling a lifelong love of learning, it's finally my turn! Before all that, I originally studied [Computational Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/), got a MS Computer Science in [Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Stanford](https://hci.stanford.edu/), then did freelance work with interactive programming and design.

## Projects

Here's some project I'm involved actively in:

- **[AiSafety.info](/2022/03/15/stampy.html)** is an educational program headed by [Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMilesAI) and part of [Alignment Ecosystem Development](https://alignment.dev/). After putting together a prototype for a [Q&A Chatbot](/2023/07/15/chatbot.html), I'm now leading the project management with a team of talented devlopers. Previously, I worked on their [logo redesign](/2022/11/20/stampy-min-logo.html) and did some light coding to implement [browser-based semantic search](/2022/07/05/use.html).

- **[FAR.AI](/2022/12/01/goattack-poster.html)** is an AI Alignment research group where I work on communicating results to the larger AI research community. I've been truly fortunate to help on some exciting projects. At the moment, the field of [mechanistic interpretability of LLMs](/2023/06/30/mech-interpret.html) is particularly fascinating to me especially given my background in Lingusitics, Computer Science, and Education.

- **[Women Techmakers Ambassadors](/2022/12/07/wtm-ambassador.html)** is an outreach program sponsored by Google. Through it, I've had the opportunity to meet many inspirational women in tech, organize a 6-hour International Women's Day [Dare to be Creative in Tech](https://ccstan99.github.io/2023/03/22/wtm-iwd.html) event, and attend [Google I/O in-person](https://ccstan99.github.io/2023/05/10/google-io.html). I'm also tremendously grateful for resources and support as I plod through the [GCP Machine Learning Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/machine-learning-engineer) professional certification with an WTM-organized study group.

## Presentations

The lovely people at [DataCircles](https://datacircles.org/) provided a supportive environment when I was first learning and sharing about AI & ML. Here's slides from m presentations:

- [AGI Safety](/docs/JournalClub%202022-03-02%20AGI%20Safety.pdf)
- [AI Gridworlds](/docs/JournalClub%202022-03-30%20AI%20Gridworlds.pdf)
- [Winograd Schema Challenge](/docs/JournalClub%202022-05-25%20NLP.pdf)
- [Sentence-BERT](/docs/JournalClub%202022-07-27%20SBERT.pdf)
- [OpenAI's Codex](/docs/JournalClub%202022-09-14%20Codex.pdf)
- [Classification Metrics](/docs/HOML%20Ch3.pdf)
- [Training Models](/docs/HOML%20Ch4.pdf)
- [Dimensionality Reduction](/docs/HOML%20Ch8.pdf)
- [What is NLP?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3N7zoIcjtw&list=PLSGYwl5_qS6jEhXHXuEymvNYvrFuD2BOG&index=1)
- [What are Transformers?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bedJ9bQBG6s&list=PLSGYwl5_qS6jEhXHXuEymvNYvrFuD2BOG&index=2)

## Mentoring

For those interested in exploring STEM, here's some excellent organizations:

- **[AI4ALL](/2022/08/11/ai4all.html)** — As a mentor for portfolio projects, I created some tutorials to guide students to perform NLP classification by fine-tuning BERT on their dataset and also develop LLMs apps with LangChain.
- **[Technovation Challenge](/2022/06/23/technovation.html)** — Last few years, I've served as judge advisor, but I began by mentoring a team to create a mobile app social good. The [Rooting for You](https://sites.google.com/view/code-work-ahead/) app was the 2020 North America Regional Winner!
- **[Stanford's Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)** — I've been involved with this program since their inception during the pandemic, initially as a section leader every year then also served as a teaching mentor. If you're interested in transitioning into tech and have the chance, this program is a well-organized and wonderful opportunity to learn Python. The instructors are passionate, which is unfortunately all to rare in this field, and is based on Stanford's immenesly popular introduction to CS curriculum. And it's free!
- **[Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)** - If you're early in your career or considering a transition with hopes to make a positive impact in the world, look into the [EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook) or [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) to learn about promising career paths.
