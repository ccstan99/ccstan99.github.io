I currently work and play in the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Safety. With a MS Computer Science in [Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Stanford](https://hci.stanford.edu/) and a BA in [Linguistics & Computer Science from UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/), my journey began with freelance work in UI/UX research, programming, and design during the nascent stages of the web. Life took me on a rewarding detour to homeschool my kiddos. Now, I'm back, exploring the latest in AI and eager to share my lifelong love of learning with the world!

## Current Projects

Check out the organizations I'm involved with, blending research, community, and advocacy.

- **[FAR.AI](http://far.ai)**: An AI Alignment research accelerator where I communicate findings to the broader ML research community. Projects I've enjoyed include : [LLMs Learning Wellbeing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11777), [VLM-RM](/2023/10/20/vlm-rm.html), [Go Attack](/2022/12/01/goattack-poster.html) & [Optimal Behavior Prior](/2022/11/30/obp-poster.html).

- **[AiSafety.info](/2022/03/15/stampy.html)**: Serving in an advisory capacity, I contributed to the project management and development of the [Q&A Chatbot](/2023/07/15/chatbot.html), [semantic search](/2022/07/05/use.html) & [UI/UX](/2022/11/20/stampy-min-logo.html) for early protoypes. This AI Safety FAQ platform addresses key inquiries in the field.

- **[Women Techmakers Ambassadors](/2022/12/07/wtm-ambassador.html)**: Supported by Google, this global initiative aligns with my dedication to creating an inclusive tech landscape where all women can flourish. My involvement extends to volunteering with [AI4ALL](/2022/08/11/ai4all.html), [Technovation Challenge](/2022/06/23/technovation.html), [Women Who Code](https://womenwhocode.com/) & other [events](/events), reinforcing my commitment to this mission.

## Further Explorations

Join me on a voyage of learning and discovery through a curated selection of [AI/NLP Courses & Journals](/resources) that have shaped my journey, alongside the myriad of books that fuel my curiosity on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/150236560-ccstan99?shelf=read). These resources and readings span the gamut from artificial intelligence to the wonderfully unexpected, offering a glimpse into the topics that capture my imagination.
