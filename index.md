After years of homeschooling my kids, instilling a lifelong love of learning, it's finally my turn! I've been immersed in all the exciting developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP). Before all that, I did freelance work with interactive programming and design. I originally studied [Computational Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/) then earned a MS Computer Science in [Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Stanford](https://hci.stanford.edu/). 

## Readings
- [AI/NLP Courses & Journals](/resources) - Resources that helped me start
- [Goodreads Bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/150236560-ccstan99?shelf=read) - All sorts of rabbit holes

## Presentations
The lovely people at [DataCircles](https://datacircles.org/) have provided a supportive environment to learn and share about AI & ML. Here's slides from my recent presentations:
- [AI Safety](/docs/JournalClub%202022-03-02%20AGI%20Safety.pdf)
- [AI Gridworlds](/docs/JournalClub%202022-03-30%20AI%20Gridworlds.pdf)
- [Winograd Schema Challenge](/docs/JournalClub%202022-05-25%20NLP.pdf)
- [Sentence-BERT](/docs/JournalClub%202022-07-27%20SBERT.pdf)
- [Classification Metrics](/docs/HOML%20Ch3.pdf)
- [Training Models](/docs/HOML%20Ch4.pdf)
- [Dimensionality Reduction](/docs/HOML%20Ch8.pdf)

## Projects
The AGI Alignment ecosystem has interesting projects I've been helping with:
- [Stampy](ui.stampy.ai) - AGI Safety & Alignment FAQ headed by [Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMilesAI). I worked on the front-end UI/UX, [logo redesign](https://github.com/StampyAI/StampyAIAssets), and did some [light coding](https://github.com/StampyAI/stampy-ui): implemented in-browser semantic search & identified duplicate questions using NLP, created web workers to avoid GUI blocking issues, and used GitHub Actions to automate embeddings generation & website deployment.

## Mentoring
For students interested in STEM, here's some wonderful organizations:
- [AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/) - As a mentor for the summer portfolio project, I put together a quick [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/docs/HuggingFace_Tutorial.ipynb) to get students started with NLP classification tasks, fine-tuning Transformer models on Hugging Face.
- [Technovation Challenge](https://www.technovation.org/) - I've been a judge advisor the last few years, but I began by mentoring a team to create a mobile app social good. Their app [Rooting for You](https://sites.google.com/view/code-work-ahead/) was the North America Regional Winner in 2020!
