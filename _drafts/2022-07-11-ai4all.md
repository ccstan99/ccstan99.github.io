## AI4ALL

[AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/) opens doors to Artificial Intelligence for historically excluded talent through education and mentorship.

Their summer camps first entered our radar for my daughter, who had a long-time interest in AI. She absolutely loved attending the 3-week camp at Princeton in 2019 which included extensive curriculum covering various ML algorithms, hands on research project working with genomic data, and a trip to Washington DC to learn more about AI policy making. I was particularly impressed with the alumni AI Changemakers network and frequent updates with opportunities for internships and continued education. Her enthusiasm for the program was infectious. Soon, I found myself following and learning these new concepts.

AI4ALL has an in-depth applicant screening process.

## Conclusion

I can fully attest that "Teaching is the best way to learn." While homeschooling my kids for over a decade, I was constantly learning new material and always thinking, "How would I explain this?" That mentality forced me to think more deeply and analytically, knowing that I couldn't get away with hand-waving explanations if I wanted my own kids to truly understand. As the kids are off continuing their education in more traditional settings now, it was a natural transition for me to return to my work in the technology sector but also mentor other students. Mentoring has been an excellent way to supercharge my upskilling. I previously wrote about my experience with [Technovations](http://localhost:4000/2022/06/23/technovation.html).

I'd love to learn more about the many other wonderful programs out there. If you haven't had a chance to share your skills through mentoring, definitely give it a try!
