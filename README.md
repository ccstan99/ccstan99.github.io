# Welcome

You've stumbled into my personal journal! I originally studied [Computational Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/) then MS Computer Science in [Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Stanford](https://hci.stanford.edu/). I've worked as a software engineer then freelanced in UI/UX before taking an extended break to homeschool my kids.

## Readings
After teaching all these years, instilling a lifelong love of learning, it's finally my turn again! I've been having a blast reading and exploring all kinds of rabbit holes:
- [AI/NLP Courses & Journals](RESOURCES.md) - Resources that got me started
- [Goodreads Bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/150236560-ccstan99?shelf=read) - General knowledge & random interests

## Presentations
I've found a lovely group at [DataCircles](https://datacircles.org/) where we share our learning in AI/ML. Here's some slides from my past presentations:
- [AI Safety](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-03-02%20AGI%20Safety.pdf)
- [AI Gridworlds](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-03-30%20AI%20Gridworlds.pdf)
- [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-05-25%20NLP.pdf)
- [Sentence-BERT](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-07-27%20SBERT.pdf)
- [Classification Metrics](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-Bookclub/HOML%20Ch3.pdf)
- [Training Models](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-Bookclub/HOML%20Ch4.pdf)
- [Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-Bookclub/HOML%20Ch8.pdf)

## Projects
I've been helping out in the AGI Alignment ecosystem.
- [Stampy](ui.stampy.ai) - AGI Safety & Alignment FAQ headed by [Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMilesAI). I worked on the front-end UI/UX, [logo redesign](https://github.com/StampyAI/StampyAIAssets), and did some [light coding](https://github.com/StampyAI/stampy-ui): implemented in-browser semantic search & identified duplicate questions using NLP, used web workers to avoid GUI blocking issues, and created GitHub Actions to automate embeddings generation and website deployment.

## Mentoring
For students interested in STEM, here are some wonderful organizations I'm involved with:
- [AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/) - As a mentor for the summer portfolio project, I put together a quick [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/Tutorial-Notebooks/HuggingFace_Tutorial.ipynb) to get students started with NLP classification tasks, fine-tuning Transformer models on Hugging Face.
- [Technovation Challenge](https://www.technovation.org/) - I've been a judge advisor the last few years, but I began by mentoring a team to create a mobile app social good. Their app [Rooting for You](https://sites.google.com/view/code-work-ahead/) was the North America Regional Winner in 2020!
