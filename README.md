# Welcome

You've stumbled into my personal journal! I originally studied [Computational Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/) then MS Computer Science in [Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Stanford](https://hci.stanford.edu/). I've worked as a software engineer then freelanced in UI/UX before taking a long break to [homeschool my kids while traveling the world](https://www.cheng2.com/blog/).

## Readings
After teaching for all these years, trying to instill a lifelong love of learning, I've decided it's now my turn! I've been having a blast reading and exploring in general:
- [AI/NLP Courses & Journals](RESOURCES.md) - List of invaluable resources to get started in the feild
- [Goodreads Bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/150236560-ccstan99?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read) - Some related to AI/NP but others of just general knowledge & instersts.

## Presentations
I've found a great group at the DataCircles based in Seattle where we share what we've been learning in AI/ML. Here's some slides from my recent presentations & workshops:
- [AGI Safety](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-03-02%20AGI%20Safety.pdf)
- [AI Gridworlds](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-03-30%20AI%20Gridworlds.pdf)
- [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-JournalClub/JournalClub%202022-05-25%20NLP.pdf)
- [Sentence-BERT]()
- [Classification Metrics](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-Bookclub/HOML%20Ch3.pdf)
- [Training Models](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-Bookclub/HOML%20Ch4.pdf)
- [Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/DataCircles-Bookclub/HOML%20Ch8.pdf)

## Projects
I've helping out in the AGI Alignment ecosystem
- [Stampy](ui.stampy.ai) - AGI Safety & Alignment FAQ headed by [Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMilesAI), AI Alignment communicator. I worked on the front-end UI/UX, [logo redesign](https://github.com/StampyAI/StampyAIAssets), and helped with some [light coding](https://github.com/StampyAI/stampy-ui). Implemented semantic search and identified potential duplicate questions using NLP, created web worker to avoid GUI blocking issues, and used GitHub Actions to automate embeddings generation and website deployment.

## Mentoring
For students interested in STEM, here are some great organizations I'm involved with
- [AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/) - Summer portfolio project. As a mentor, I wrote a quick [Colab Notebook](https://github.com/ccstan99/ccstan99.github.io/blob/main/Tutorial-Notebooks/HuggingFace_Tutorial.ipynb) to get students started with NLP classification tasks using Hugging Face.
- [Technovation Challenge](https://www.technovation.org/) - I've been a Judge Advisor the last few years but I began by Mentoring a team to create a mobile app social good. Their app [Rooting for You](https://sites.google.com/view/code-work-ahead/) was the North America Regional Winner in 2020!
