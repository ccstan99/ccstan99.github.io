I dare not claim to be an expert but my kids tell me I'm pretty good at explaining things. Since I spent 10+ years homeschooling them, I consider that precious praise. I learn best by teaching, so please [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheng2-tan/) if you'd like me to speak on:

- Demystifying AI & LLMs
- Using AI in Education
- Building Chatbots with Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Designing Your Life & Career for Women in Tech
- Relaunching after a Career Break
- Preparing Engaging Tech Presentations
