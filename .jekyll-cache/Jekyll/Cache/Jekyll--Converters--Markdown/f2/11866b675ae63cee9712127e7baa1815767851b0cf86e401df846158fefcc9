I"Ä<p>I just finished the NLP specialization through DeepLearning.ai on Coursera. I also went through the Stanford CS224n course in NLP and read a bunch of journal articles. Sorting through alphabet soup was an undertaking in itself. Since I kept referring to my notes to compare features between the different language models and looking up benchmark datasets &amp; sources, I figured Iâ€™d plop the charts here in case theyâ€™re helpful for others.</p>
