I"©<p>I just finished the NLP specialization through DeepLearning.ai on Coursera. I also went through the Stanford CS224n course in NLP and read a bunch of journal articles. A major portion seemed like sorting through alphabet soup. Since I kept referring to my notes comparing the features for the different language models and benchmark datasets, I figured Iâ€™d plop the charts here in case theyâ€™re helpful for others.</p>
