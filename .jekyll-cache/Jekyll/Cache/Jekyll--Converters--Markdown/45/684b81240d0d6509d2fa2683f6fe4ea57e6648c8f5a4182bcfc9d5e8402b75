I"F<p>I just finished the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing">DeepLearning.ai’s NLP specialization</a> on Coursera. I also went through the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">Stanford CS224n course in NLP</a> and read a bunch of journal articles. Sorting through alphabet soup was an undertaking in itself. Since I kept referring to my notes to compare features between the different language models and looking up benchmark datasets &amp; sources, I figured I’d pop the tables here in case they’re helpful for others.</p>
