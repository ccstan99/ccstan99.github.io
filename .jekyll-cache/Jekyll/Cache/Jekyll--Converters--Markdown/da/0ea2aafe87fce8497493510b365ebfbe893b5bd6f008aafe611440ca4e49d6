I"ù<p>I just finished the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing">DeepLearning.aiâ€™s NLP specialization</a> on Coursera. I also went through the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">Stanford CS224n course in NLP</a> and read a bunch of journal articles. Sorting through alphabet soup was an undertaking in itself. Since I kept referring to my notes to compare features between the different language models and looking up benchmark datasets &amp; sources, I figured Iâ€™d plop the charts here in case theyâ€™re helpful for others.</p>
