[Google I/O 2023](https://io.google/2023/) proved to be a memorable experience in so many ways!

## Pre-Reception

The event kicked off with the Women Techmakers Ambassadors at the pre-reception on Tuesday evening. It was such an exciting moment to finally meet and connect with Creatives in Tech in person. We were buzzing with anticipation, eager to learn from each other and soak up all the knowledge and inspiration that awaited us.

## Keynote at Shoreline

One of the highlights of the event was undoubtedly the I/O keynote addresses. It was wonderful to witness Google's announcements firsthand and watch the impressive AI/ML demos. The entire event was incredibly well-organized, right from the convenient shuttle services to the delicious breakfast and lunch options. And to our surprise, we were even provided with caps, sweatshirts, sunscreen, rain ponchos, and hand warmers - they truly had us covered for any unexpected weather or situation.

## Breakouts at Bay View

After the keynote, we had the chance to attend breakout sessions at Google's new Bayview campus. It was an opportunity to delve deeper into topics like women in leadership and AI/ML. The sessions were informative, engaging, and filled with valuable insights. We couldn't resist exploring the beautiful campus and taking advantage of the bike trails. It was a refreshing way to unwind and enjoy the surroundings.
