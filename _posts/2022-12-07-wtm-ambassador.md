I'm delighted to share that I recently became a Google's Women Techmakers (WTM) Ambassador, joining a vibrant community of over 1000 women from around the world who are passionate about technology and dedicated to fostering equity and diversity in the tech industry. The onboarding introduced me to the program's mission, resources, and the many ways in which I can contribute to my community.

After working in tech for many years now, I've gotten to the "sea of dudes". Until recently, I'd never been involved with any movements geared towards women in tech. I've worked with great guys but I've realized that working with other women in tech has such a refreshingly nurturing vibe. Now, I'm wondering: Why didn't I start sooner?!

## Notification & Onboarding

In mid-November, I received a notification that I had been selected as a WTM Ambassador. The application process evaluated past leadership experience, so it was humbling to be recognized as part of this global community of change-makers. The global onboarding was held in early December, then followed by the North American onboarding the next week. During these sessions, the WTM team highlighted the diverse ways in which we can contribute to the community's growth. From speaking at events and organizing meet-ups to mentoring aspiring individuals and creating valuable resources such as blogs or podcasts, the ambassador role is truly multi-faceted. Google also provides continuing development for technical and applied skills. Together, these set the stage for collaboration and global networking.

## International Women's Day

The International Women's Day (IWD) events from March through April are a highlight for WTM. These annual events serve as a powerful platform to celebrate the achievements of women in tech and inspire future generations. Google offers incentives and support to WTM Ambassadors helping contribute to the success of IWD by organizing events, spreading awareness, while making a meaningful impact.

As I embark on this incredible journey as a Women Techmakers Ambassador, I'm filled with excitement and gratitude. I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to support others in tech. The opportunity to be a part of a global network of like-minded individuals and the chance to make a tangible impact in my community are priceless.
