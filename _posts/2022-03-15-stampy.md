## Stampy UI

I was recently asked to work on the Stampy project, an FAQ about AGI Safety & Alignment. But what do stamps have to do with this? And what's alignment about? I'll let [Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/c/robertmilesai) explain his vision behind [stampy.ai](https://stampy.ai/wiki/Stampy).

In any case, I was thrilled to work on something related to AI. Coincidentally, I just took a detour into reading quite a bit about AGI Safety and Alignment lately. To start, I was given the [Excalidraw sketch](https://excalidraw.com/) below with all the features and the general idea of what they wanted for their website.

## Prototype

It's been quite some time since I did any UI/UX work, so I'm rather rusty. However, I had the fundamentals & intuition from years of conducting user research studies and designing interactions in my previous life. Just from casually keeping tabs on trends, I knew that Figma was now a market leader for rapid prototyping, so I first went through their ["Getting Started with Figma"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2dkpBxst8&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4) playlist of tutorials, which were actually very well done. Soon, I felt comfortable enough to put together this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/proto/gm06d1l5stMlnKxeElWBEc/Stampy-AI-Alignment-FAQ?node-id=116%3A415), wireframe, then prototype the basic interactions.

## Logo Redesign

The existing logo was much beloved within the community. However, I wanted to clean it up a bit, to hopefully simplify things for later marketing and animation purposes. There were a few key elements they wanted retained: the backdrop for the face is the valuable [inverted Jenny stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_Jenny) and the eyes of the friendly [Microsoft Clippy office assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant), with a nod to the paperclip maximizing conundrum presented in Nick Bostrom's [Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies). The [new logo](https://github.com/StampyAI/StampyAIAssets) (left) is mostly a modernized rendition of the original (right) but has more geometric shapes for whimsy and softer, gentler eyes.

## Results

Overall, I tried to keep the design clean and minimalistic, allowing users to focus on the content. To add a bit of fun, the icons switch from black & white into full color on hover. The banner is decorated with colorful geometric figures which actually form a secret message. Here's final mockup with the new logo.

Edited to add: We had a soft launch for the [alpha version](http://www.ui.stampy.ai) in July. I also wrote about working on their [semantic search](http://localhost:4000/2022/07/05/use.html) and identifying [duplicate questions](http://localhost:4000/2022/06/14/sbert.html). If you're interested in getting involved with AGI Safety and Alignment or would like to get work on some [open source projects](https://github.com/StampyAI), we'd love for you to join the [Discord group](https://stampy.ai/wiki/Discord_invite)!

It's been refreshing to take a little break from all the reading & studying and actually building something. Learning comes in so many shapes!
